# banking-app-cpp-2025
This is my attempt to take a simple begginer project and eventually build this up to a functioning app with a GUI interface. 

I am trying to get this into a running professional grade application. Sounds crazy but it is a hobby project of a board Cybersecuirity major who should've did Computer Science instead.

This document is going to be written for linux. I may make it more cross platform in the future but I plan on working with the app and building its complexity first.
