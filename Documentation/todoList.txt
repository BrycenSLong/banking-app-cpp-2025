Chore checklist for this project so far.

- Associate account data from an assigned username(pull this information and display it.)
- Make signup method.
-Make A UI (potentially javascript(react), Kolton, or something else).
- Make this a crossplatform app
- This needs a network stack.
- Once login and sign up are more defined, make a database for these credentials.
- All the login and sign up logic either needs to be pushed into its own file or it needs to 
be defined as it's own functions outside of main (THE LOGIC IN MAIN NEEDS TO BE DECLUTTERED).

- Right now I am trying to tackle the logic to pull up account info as you login from the 
class template of BankAccount.
